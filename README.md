## Steps to get started
1. Make sure you have a functional git installation and a command line system to go with it
You can check to see if you already have git installed by writing `git version` on your console. If you don't already have git, you need to install it. If you have Ubuntu for Windows or you're working on an unix-based system, this can be as easy as 
`sudo apt-get install git`. For Windows, see https://git-scm.com/
2. Set up your remote host & other config
