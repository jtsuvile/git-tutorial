## Before the class

### Install git / make sure you have git installed
1. Windows users only 

If you have not already, install a bash shell for your Windows. Preferably Ubuntu or Linux bash shell. Instructions e.g. https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/ and https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview 

2. Find your command line tool
  * In Mac and other unix systems it’s called Terminal and it comes built in 
  * In Windows, it’s the one you just installed
  
3. Make sure you have git installed

  In your command line interface, type `git --version` and press enter. If you have git installed, you will see a message like 
`git version 2.21.0 (Apple Git-122)`

Else, you will see something like 
`'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`

4. If you do not have git installed, install it. 

You can use instructions from e.g. here https://www.atlassian.com/fi/git/tutorials/install-git . 
  * Windows users: note that you should follow the Linux instructions and carry out the installation in your bash shell
  
5. Create a GitHub account. 

You can get the pro features for free by registering at https://education.github.com/students, but you can also complete these tasks with a regular account
